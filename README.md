# ipfs-echo
Echos text into files on ipfs then outputs the hash.
Intended to streamline the process of posting small chunks of data to ipfs, such as from an arduino project.

# Setup

  sh init.sh

# Build

  sh build.sh

# Usage

  mono ipfs-echo.exe "Hello world!" -h
  
The -h argument tells ipfs-echo to only output the hash, with other output details excluded.
This hash can be used to access the data via ipfs.

Example output:

  QmQzCQn4puG4qu8PVysxZmscmQ5vT1ZXpqo7f58Uh9QfyY

After using ipfs-echo go to:

  http://ipfs.io/ipfs/[hash]
  
Example ipfs URL:

  http://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQzCQn4puG4qu8PVysxZmscmQ5vT1ZXpqo7f58Uh9QfyY
